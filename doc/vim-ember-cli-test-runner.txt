1. Intro                                      *vim-ember-cli-test-runner-intro*

If you are a Vim user and write Ember apps using ember-cli then this plugin is
for you. With this plugin you can run all of the tests for your Ember project,
a single module of tests, or one individual test all without leaving your Vim
buffer.

2. Requirements                        *vim-ember-cli-test-runner-requirements*

You will need to have [vim-dispatch](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch)
installed for this plugin to run the tests in an asynchronous manner.

3. Usage                                      *vim-ember-cli-test-runner-usage*

The plugin provides three commands:

``` text
RunAllEmberTests
RunSingleEmberTest
RunSingleEmberTestModule
```

Ensure that your cursor is within a module or test as appropriate for the
desired command that you are trying to run.

4. Licence                                  *vim-ember-cli-test-runner-licence*
